[Verse 1]
I remember years ago
Someone told me I should take
Caution when it comes to love
I did
I did
You were strong and I was not
My illusion, my mistake
I was careless, I forgot
I did

[Pre-Chorus]
And now, when all is done
There is nothing to say
You have gone and so effortlessly
You have won
You can go ahead, tell them
